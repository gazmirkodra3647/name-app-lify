/**
 * filename: complexCode.js
 * 
 * This code implements a complex algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
 * The TSP is a classic algorithmic problem in computer science and optimization theory.
 * The code uses a combination of dynamic programming and greedy heuristics to find an approximate
 * solution for the TSP.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Define a graph with distances between all pairs of cities.
 * 2. Implement a function to calculate the minimum cost of visiting a subset of cities, starting from a given city.
 * 3. Use dynamic programming to iterate through all possible subsets of cities and calculate their minimum costs.
 * 4. Implement a greedy heuristic to find a feasible solution by selecting the next city with the minimum cost.
 * 5. Iterate the greedy heuristic until all cities are visited.
 * 6. Output the sequence of cities and the total cost.
 * 
 * Note: This code assumes the input graph is complete, meaning there is a direct connection between every pair of cities.
